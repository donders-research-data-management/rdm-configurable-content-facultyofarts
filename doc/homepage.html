<h1 class="page-header">Welcome to the Faculty of Arts Data Repository Pilot</h1>

<p>Academic research is one of the core tasks of the Faculty of Arts. All our research is carried out at one of the two faculty's research institutes: <a href="http://www.ru.nl/cls/">the Centre for Language Studies (CLS)</a> and <a href="http://www.ru.nl/hlcs/">the Institute for Historical, Literary and Cultural Studies (HLCS)</a>. At CLS, innovative research is carried out in the fields of linguistics, language, speech technology and communication, while HLCS is at the forefront of bringing together the facultyâ€™s (art) historical, literary and cultural research.</p>
